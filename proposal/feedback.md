This looks great - really thoughtful proposal, and I think you've done a nice job thinking about risks and programmatics. 

I'm not 100% I get your approach through, partly because I don't really know much about NFL.  It seems to me you may have college performance of a set of pro players, and the WAV scores for pros (which is some measure of career performance).  With this. you would basically be clustering upcoming amateurs with this data to figure out which amateurs are likely to "succeed" (operationalized through WAV).  But, why not just build a classifier here?  Why bother with the clustering?  I suspect there's something I don't quite understand...

In any case, this is a good proposal and I think you can move ahead with it.

SCORE: 5/5
