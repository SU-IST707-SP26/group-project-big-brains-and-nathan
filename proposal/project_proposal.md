Project Proposal

Hi my name is Nathan
Test


Risks:
Team needs (not all need skill players), shockers (reaching for players, players falling down draft boards, trades), evaluating different archetypes of players (receiving back - CMC vs. workhorse back - Derrick Henry, blocking tight end vs. receiving tight end, yards after catch receiver vs. other)
