Project Proposal

### Introduction
The three-day NFL Draft is the one of the most critical days of the calendar year for NFL franchises because players selected can set up a team’s future for years to come or set them back for a long time. Many comparisons and eye-tests are used by front-offices and scouts to pick “their guy” in the draft, but every process has its flaws. In this project, we are predicting NFL career success of skill players (quarterbacks, running backs, wide receivers, and tight ends) in the upcoming draft by using collegiate data and former drafted players as reference points. In this new approach, we are using machine learning on the collegiate data to create a score that values player success, then run a clustering model to compare players in the draft class and previously drafted players. We find these two models as the most optimal for this problem because they are better at separating hype around players, letting the numbers do the talking. Our stakeholders in this project will be NFL front-offices and coaches, as well as any media outlets that make NFL Draft predictions. In the case of the front-offices and coaches, a successful project will help improve scouting departments and simplify draft-day decisions due to having an algorithm that shows which skill players can have the best careers. For media outlets, this impacts any analyst or personality that shares their mock drafts as the season comes to a close. This project would help solidify who the top players are, reducing noise in which players A and B will have better careers than players C and D. 



Risks: 

Hunter's notes- Team needs (not all need skill players), shockers (reaching for players, players falling down draft boards, trades), evaluating different archetypes of players (receiving back - CMC vs. workhorse back - Derrick Henry, blocking tight end vs. receiving tight end, yards after catch receiver vs. other)
